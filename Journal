I originally just started searching for what kind of keyboard I wanted, and what i needed. I was completely new to building keyboards, so i assembled a rough BOM. I decided to go with 75% since it wouldn't be overwhelming, but still include everything that I needed. I went with a raspberry pico since I was somewhat familiar with it, and decided to include a knob for volume and backlighting. I also decided to make the case of the keyboard clear, to display the PCB. Not gonna lie, this day mainly consisted of scrolling pinterest and reddit to get a vague idea of what I was doing. I included one of my inspriation pictures for the later design.
