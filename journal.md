I originally just started searching for what kind of keyboard I wanted, and what i needed. 
I was completely new to building keyboards, so i assembled a rough BOM. I decided to go with 75% since it wouldn't be overwhelming,
but still include everything that I needed. I went with a raspberry pico since I was somewhat familiar with it, 
and decided to include a knob for volume and backlighting. 
I also decided to make the case of the keyboard clear, to display the PCB. 
Not gonna lie, this day mainly consisted of scrolling pinterest and reddit to get a vague idea of what I was doing. 
I included one of my inspiration pictures below a design I liked

Created the original schematic for the keyboard. I went back and forth with including the LEDs due to power usage, 
but i included them in the final design. Basic math tells me that it won't explode, chatGPT says it will. Oh well.
The second schematic I've made. I somehow managed to mess up the amount of keys around 5 times, which slowed the 
process quite a bit.

I somehow managed to do the entire PCB setup and routing in one day. Unfortunately, the footprint for the pico I was using was inaccurate and didn't actually support through-hole soldering. I was trying to be careful about the layout, considering the case might expose how bad it looked if it was a train wreck. I included a picture of when i was still moving the footprints.
